<p class="GreenText">
Hi my name is <em>Kevin Doan</em>. I am from <strong>Brampton, Ontario.</strong> I am currently studying at <strong>Brock University</strong> for <strong>Business Economics.</strong><br /><br /> I am a first year student and enjoy hanging out with my friends and family. I have four older brothers which are <em>Ryan, Henry,</em> and <em>Quyet</em> (youngest to oldest). I took this course because I enjoy using technology. Today's time almost everything involves computers. I am also very interested in cryptocurrency, which is why I want to learn more about technology.<br /><br />

<p>
<strong>Toronto</strong><br /><br />
During my summer I spent most of my time staying over <strong>Toronto</strong>. There are always events happening and an endless variety of food to eat. I also hanged out with a lot of friends from high school since we were all going to different <em>universities</em>. I also learnt a lot this summer about crypto-currency which changed my interest in school.<br /><br />

Here is a list in order of my favourite things to do in Toronto.
